1. What is python?
Ans: Python is a high-level, interpreted, object-oriented programming language. It was first released in 1991 and is widely used in a variety of fields including web development, data science, scientific computing, and artificial intelligence. Python is known for its simple syntax, code readability, and large standard library, making it a popular choice for beginners and experienced programmers. It is also highly extensible, meaning that you can use C or C++ code libraries to perform computationally intensive tasks or require access to low-level system resources.

2. What are the applications of Python?
Ans: Python is a versatile language and is used in a wide range of applications. 
Some common areas where Python is used include:
a.Web development: Python can be used to build server-side web applications.
b.Scientific and numeric computing: Python is a popular language for scientific and numeric computing, with libraries such as NumPy and SciPy providing support for array operations, linear algebra, and other mathematical operations.
c.Artificial intelligence and machine learning: Python has several libraries and frameworks that support the development of machine learning models, including TensorFlow and scikit-learn.
d.Data analysis and visualization: Python has libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib that make it easy to perform data analysis and visualization.
e.Desktop GUI applications: Python can be used to build cross-platform desktop applications with libraries such as PyQt and Kivy.

3. Variables in Python and its types.
Ans: Variables in python are reserved memory locations to store values, and identifiers to reference a value in a program that stores and manipulates data.
To create a variable in Python, we just need to give it a name and assign a value to it using the equal sign (=). 
For example:
x = 10
This creates a variable called x and assigns it the value 10. We can then use the variable x in your program by referring to its name. 
For example:
print(x)
This would output 10 to the screen.
In Python, variables do not have a fixed type. This means that we can assign a value of any type to a variable. 
For example:
x = 10
x = "hello"
In the first line, the variable x is assigned an integer value. In the second line, it is assigned a string value. This is known as dynamic typing, and it is one of the features of Python that makes it a flexible and easy-to-use language.
Types of variable:
a.Global
b.Local
c.Enclosing
d.Built-in

4. Functions in Python.
Ans: A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. Functions are used to modularize code and to make it easier to reuse.
To define a function in Python, we use the def keyword followed by the name of the function and a set of parentheses.
To call a function in Python, we use the function's name followed by a set of parentheses. We can also pass arguments inside the parentheses to pass data to the function.
Functions can be defined inside other functions and can also be passed as arguments to other functions. This allows us to write flexible and modular code in Python.

5. Operators in Python.
Ans: In Python, operators are special symbols that represent calculations or actions. 
Some common operators in Python include:
    +: Addition
    -: Subtraction
    *: Multiplication
    /: Division
    %: Modulo (remainder)
    **: Exponentiation
    //: Integer division (the division that results in a whole number)
These operators can be used to perform various calculations on values and variables. 
For example:
x = 10
y = 5

print(x + y)  # Outputs 15
print(x - y)  # Outputs 5
print(x * y)  # Outputs 50
print(x / y)  # Outputs 2.0
print(x % y)  # Outputs 0
print(x ** y)  # Outputs 100000
print(x // y)  # Outputs 2

In addition to these arithmetic operators, Python also has several comparison operators that allow you to compare values. These include:
    ==: Equal to
    !=: Not equal to
    <: Less than
    >: Greater than
    <=: Less than or equal to
    >=: Greater than or equal to
Comparison operators return a Boolean value (either True or False) depending on the result of the comparison. 
For example:
x = 10
y = 5

print(x == y)  # Outputs False
print(x != y)  # Outputs True
print(x < y)  # Outputs False
print(x > y)  # Outputs True
print(x <= y)  # Outputs False
print(x >= y)  # Outputs True

Python also has several logical operators that allow you to combine multiple comparisons. These include:
    and: True if both comparisons are true
    or: True if either comparison is true
    not: True if the comparison is false

Logical operators return a Boolean value (either True or False) depending on the result of the comparison. 
For example:
x = 10
y = 5

print(x < 20 and y < 10)  # Outputs True
print(x < 20 or y < 10)  # Outputs True
print(not(x < 20))  # Outputs False
